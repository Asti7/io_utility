# myio

Myio is a simple alternative to standard C i/o library. It utilises low level system calls to achive basic input/output functionality. 


## Why ? 

Implementing the myio libraray was part of the [FIT2100 Operating Systems](https://handbook.monash.edu/2021/units/FIT2100) curriculum, being part of Assignment 1 for summer semester B 2021.

Also, I hate using format specifiers in C for trivial input and output stuff ðŸ˜¬, it just leads to more keyboard presses ðŸ˜†
