# myio

Myio is a simple alternative to standard C i/o library. It utilises low level system calls achive basic input/output functionality. 


## Why ? 

Implementing the myio libraray was part of the FIT2100 Operating Systems curriculum, being part of Assignment 1 for summer semester B 2021.

Also, I hate using format specifiers in C for trivial input and output stuff ðŸ˜¬, it just leads to more keyboard presses ðŸ˜†.
